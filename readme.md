Windpic is an Android App for socializing with new people. Users can take pictures and send them to users nearby, setting the gender preference, minimum and maximum age and the maximum distance between them and the target user and they will receive photos only from users that match their preferences. If the user likes a photo he had received, the author is notified and they can become friends and start chatting. Each Windpic user has a profile that displays the user's name, age and Facebook profile picture. When the user sets the gender and age preferences, other users that don't match these preferences will not be able to view the user's profile or receive their pictures.
